      <p>If you're reading this, you probably read my about me. I'm very excited to be going back to school because I love learning. I'm excited to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript more in depth but I'm also very excited to begin my path on learning a lot of different languages. I really enjoy figuring out how things work so each language is a new and exciting challenge. Web development isn't my final stop though. I want to become a software engineer and work for a company that tries to progress and change the tech world. After Galvanize and once I get a job, I am going to go back to school part time and get a mechanical engineering or a computer science degree. My goal is to work for a company like Google or Rethink Robotics but a lot of other companies fall into the same category. I'm excited to be taking this journey with everyone at Galvanize.</p>
