      <p>If you're reading this, it's probably because you want to know a little about me. My name is Ronan and I'm 24 years old. Ronan is pronounced like Ronin but has a completely different meaning.  My family is a family of 5: my dad, my mom, my brother(oldest), my sister(middle), and me(youngest). I am of Irish and Mexican decent. My mom was born in Mexico so we tend to go down and visit extended family about once a year. I have never been to Ireland but plan on visiting after this course. I have lived in the same house since I was born but have been to 10 different schools in 6 different cities. Luckily, I have had the same bestfriends since I was 5 and 7 years old. Growing up I played a lot of sports but my hobby was always building things. I loved Legos, K'nex, and working with wood. My dad and I build a clubhouse in our backyard for my sister as a birthday present for her 13th birthday. That's where all the building began. As I got older we went from building bikes and ramps to engines and computers. I still enjoy a woodwork and steelwork with friends but I've grown a love for engines and coding. So most of my free time is taken up by working on cars, building motor bicycles, and learning to code. Eventually, I would like to work with one of my best friends in programming and bulding robotics.</p>
